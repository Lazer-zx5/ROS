# KDY's Original Description
I designed Spotmicro inspired by the Spotmini of Boston Dynamics.

It works on the basis of the Arduino mega, and if you use a different board, you have to redesign the 'plate' file yourself and print the 'non-mega' file instead of the regular file.

The ultra sonic sensor can be used for mapping or obstacle avoidance.

When you attach the servo horn to the 3D printed parts, you must use the HOTGLUE.

THERE IS NO CODE YET, SO YOU HAVE TO WRITE IT YOURSELF.

To make this, you need the following...

Electronics
12 × MG 996 R servo motor
1 × Arduino Mega
2 × HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor
1 × HC-06 Bluetooth module
1 × MPU-6050 Gyro sensor
1 × I2C 16x2 LCD Module
1 × Rleil rocker switch RL3-4
7.4v Battery

Screws, Nuts and Bearings
8 × 'M5×15'
40 × 'M4×20'
8 × 'M4×15'
48 × 'M4 nut'
4 × 'M3×20'
28 × 'M3×10'
16 × 'M3 nut'
8 × 'F625zz Flange ball bearing'

--------------------------------------------------Servo Upgrade--------------------------------------------------

I Uploaded upgrade parts for cls6336hv servo.

To use cls6336hv servo, print the file '~_cls'. If you want to use mg995 or mg996r servo, please print the '~_mg' file.

A file without any markings is part of any type of servo.
