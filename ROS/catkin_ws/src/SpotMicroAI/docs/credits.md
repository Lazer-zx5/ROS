First of all thanks to Kim Deok-Yeon aka KDY0523 who made [this incredible work on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3445283). Kim Deok-Yeon has updated his model for use with CLS6336HV-Servos. We will keep on using the MG996R-Servos - although they will not have enough power - but they are cheaper and we expect unwanted behaviours and servo-crashes in the first stages.
